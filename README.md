# hyper-mono-christmas
Mostly monochrome Hyper theme, but with red and green. I find having these two colors are helpful for seeing errors and success highlights for things like running tests, linters, or any CLI processes with colored outputs.

### Install

1. Open Hyper's preferences with `Cmd + ,` (or manually at `~/.hyper.js`) with your editor.
2. Update your list of plugins to include `hyper-mono-christmas`, like so:

  ```js
plugins: [
    'hyper-mono-christmas'
],
```
3. Fully reload Hyper (`Cmd+Shift+R`), and tada! :tada:
